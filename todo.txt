Roughly in order of execution:

- Implement module system in compiler.
- Create modules for "standard library" stuff, e.g., Queue.
- Streamline compilation process.
- Streamline compiler installation.


Supported in implementation, roughly in order of simplicity+importance:

- bool/string/int literals
- bool/string/int expressions

- support interface and/or function delegation
- support for passing functions (not necessarily lambdas)
