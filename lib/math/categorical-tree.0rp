// A categorical distribution represented as a tree.
//
// Params:
// #c: The type of category (i.e., object) used in the distribution.
//
// Notes:
// - CategoricalTree is intended for use in random sampling of arbitrary objects
//   based on relative weights that can be dynamically set.
// - The distribution automatically updates every time a weight is changed. This
//   can be used for updating Bayesian observations while simultaneously being
//   able to sample values from the distribution.
// - The complexity of most operations is O(log n) with n distinct #c values.
// - The required storage space is independent of the weights; it only depends
//   on the number of distinct #c values with non-zero weights.
concrete CategoricalTree<#c> {
  #c defines LessThan<#c>

  // Create a new distribution.
  @type new () -> (#self)

  // Get the sum of all weights in the distribution.
  @value getTotal () -> (Int)

  // Set the relative weight of a category.
  //
  // Notes:
  // - The weight must not be negative.
  @value setWeight (#c,Int) -> (#self)

  // Get the relative weight of a category.
  //
  // Notes:
  // - If the category isn't in the tree, its weight is 0.
  @value getWeight (#c) -> (Int)

  // Return the category at the given offset.
  //
  // Notes:
  // - The offset must be within [0,getTotal()). A uniform selection in that
  //   range will provide samples that follow the categorical distribution
  //   corresponding to the relative weights of the respective #c.
  // - The return value is deterministic. If you were to iterate over
  //   [0,getTotal()), you'd get an increasing sequence of all #c in the
  //   CategoricalTree, each repeated the number of times indicated by its
  //   respective weight.
  @value locate (Int) -> (#c)
